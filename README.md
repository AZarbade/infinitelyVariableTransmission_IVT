## About This Project
- ðŸ‘“ Miniaturizing Continuous Variable Transmission used in vehicles to be applied in Robotics applications
- ðŸ”­ To achieve precision of high gearing while keeping speed of low gearing
- ðŸ”® Precise control with enhanced speed. 
- ðŸŒ± Mostly inspired from [Inception Drive](https://spectrum.ieee.org/inception-drive-a-compact-infinitely-variable-transmission-for-robotics)
by [Alexander Kernbaum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-kernbaum-9997a628/)

## ðŸ›  Current Progress

- **CAD Model** - CAD model for the concept is done. Gear ratio ranges from 5:1 to 20:1.
