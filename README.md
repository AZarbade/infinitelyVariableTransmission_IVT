## About This Project

This project aims to develop a variable ratio gearset.

- Inspired from [Inception Drive](https://spectrum.ieee.org/inception-drive-a-compact-infinitely-variable-transmission-for-robotics)

## ðŸ›  Current Progress

- **CAD Model** - CAD model for the concept is done. Gear ratio ranges from 5:1 to 20:1.
