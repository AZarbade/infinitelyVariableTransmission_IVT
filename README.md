# IVT: Infinitely Variable Transmission
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **README IS WIP**

## TL;DR

__*Miniaturizing Continuous Variable Transmission used in vehicles to
be applied in Robotics applications. To achieve precision of high gearing while keeping speed of low gearing. \
Aim: Precise control with enhanced speed.*__ \
