## About This Project
- ðŸ‘“ Miniaturizing Continuous Variable Transmission used in vehicles to be applied in Robotics applications
- ðŸ”­ To achieve precision of high gearing while keeping speed of low gearing
- ðŸ”® Precise control with enhanced speed. 
- ðŸŒ± Mostly inspired from [Inception Drive](https://spectrum.ieee.org/inception-drive-a-compact-infinitely-variable-transmission-for-robotics)
